# Data

## Data Collection

The data used in this research was compiled by web scraping information of all Sociology and Political Science scholars from all universities in the Netherlands. In the first part of the data collection process, all relevant information was compiled about the author's position, university affiliation, names, id's, departments, etc. Next, all published works together with relevant work-related information of these authors (work id, concepts, citations, abstracts, topics, etc.), up until 2024, were scraped by using OpenAlex @priem2022openalexfullyopenindexscholarly. From this data I subsetted a final dataset, consisting of all authors from the Sociology and Political Science departments at the Radboud University and the University of Amsterdam (n=282).

Furthermore, I compared the collaboration networks in two periods of time. The first wave ranges from 2016 to 2019. The second wave ranges from 2020 to 2023. Collaboration networks were made on the basis of these waves. The networks are directed networks, which means that it is assumed that the first author sends ties to all collaborators on a specific work.

## Dependent Variable

The dependent variable in this research is the network of collaborations between researchers, where the collaborations are the ties and the researchers are the nodes @van1999multilevel. The subsequent analysis will be an attempt to *describe* and *explain* the the changes in the network and the 'behaviour' of the people that make up the network. In more formal terms, as used in the RSiena manual [@Ripley2011ManualFR], the dependent variable(s) in social network analysis are the *creation* of a tie or the *maintenance* (endowment) of a tie (technically, the breaking of a tie is also an option, but will not be considered here). In other words, the dependent variable is the network. However, the network can also 'function' as independent variable (so 'explaining' itself, for example in reciprocity, where the network effects have influence on the network structure).

## Independent Variables

### Interdisciplinarity

The main independent variable in this research is interdisciplinarity. The OpenAlex data structure assigns to each work a Topic entity. This entity is divided into 'domains', 'fields', 'subfields' and 'topics', where 'domain' is the broadest category and 'topics' is the most fine grained category (see **Figure 1**). For the subsequent analysis, I used 'fields' as the main analytic category, as this proved to be the right balance in terms of subtleness and operationalizability. Both 'subfields' and 'topics' were also tested, but proved to be either too fine-grained or too broad.

To get a measure of interdisciplinarity at the author level, I use the following formula, resulting in the Simpson's Diversity Index:

$$
SDI = 1 - \Big[\sum_{i=1}^n p_{i}^2\Big]
$$

Here, $p$ represents the proportion of works by an author working in a certain field. Squaring ensures giving more weight to the fields that are more common. So, in essence, this formula means taking the sum of all the squared proportions $p^2$ for all fields $i$ and subtracting it from 1. The Simpson's Diversity Index (SDI) can be used to measure the diversity of the authors' research practices by highlighting how 'concentrated' their works are. A score closer to 1 will reflect an engagement in a more diffused set of research fields, while a score close to 0 will reflect a more homogeneous set of research fields.

Some notes of caution should be made when using this measure of interdisciplinarity. First, the SDI *does not* measure the distance between research fields: it only measures *whether or not* a field is different from another one, but there is no qualitative comparison of fields 'among each other'. To incorporate this, one would need a measure that takes into account these distances between fields (such as the Rao-Sterling index). However, [this lies outside the scope of this research.]{.underline}

Moreover, the SDI (as well as other measures for interdisciplinarity) does not take into account the *actual* interdisciplinary contribution an author has made to a work. For example, I could be a philosopher who marginally contributes to a paragraph of a physics paper. As soon as I am listed as an author of the paper, I will have worked in the field of natural sciences (and, vice versa, the physicist will have worked in the field of philosophy). However, this is partly resolved by the squaring of $p$ (which, of course, has implications by itself, but this seems the best way to go here).

### Author position

Author position revolves around the function an author has within the university. In the raw dataset there were many descriptions for the author's functions in 2024 (many of which were overlapping. See RScript below for a full overview of the re-coding process). I reduced these categories to six distinct ones: Researcher, PhD, Post-Doc, Assistant Professor, Associate Professor and Professor.

## Analytical Strategy

The analysis will be divided in three steps. First, I will provide some descriptive statistics. These descriptives apply to the whole sample, and are presented to provide a broad overview of the data. Second, I will present some network descriptives, together with some visualizations of the networks in the two waves. This is done in order to capture some of the macro-level change in the network. Third, I will use RSiena to provide an analysis for the network evolution. RSiena works within the context of Stochastic Actor-Oriented Models, where networks are assumed to evolve based on actor attributes and preferences. Specifically, RSiena models allow researchers to attribute macro-level network evolution to micro-level changes. As such, Siena models are able to estimate parameters and distinguish selection (where the dependent variable is the network) and influence (where the dependent variable is behaviour) processes, which is beneficial when trying to research social networks.

## Descriptive Statistics

Looking at the descriptive statistics below, we can see several things. Firstly, the distribution of the SDI measure aligns with expectations, showing a relatively high number of cases with an SDI of around 0.5, while scores closer to 0 or 1 are more rare. In short, most people are "averagely" interdisciplinary. However, quite some authors seem to have an SDI of 0, indicating that there is no variation at all in the fields they work in. Section **1.6.5.1** illuminates that these authors are all PhDs (with one exception, who is a post-doc), suggesting that doctoral students indeed often tend to work 'solely' in their own field.

Second, there are no anomalies in either distributions of discipline or department (i.e. sociology/political science). 166 authors in the sample were connected to the political science department of either the RU or the UvA, and 116 authors were connected to the sociology department of either the RU or the UvA. Some authors have a university that is neither the RU nor the UvA listed under the 'Universiteit24' variable, which means that they are affiliated to the RU or the UvA in some way, but probably not as 'main' university. When looking at the SDI score grouped by University affiliation (Section **1.6.5.5**[)]{.underline}, no notable differences catch the eye. The UvA scholars have a slightly higher mean SDI of 0.45, with RU scholars having a mean SDI of 0.40.

Third, when looking at the differences in SDI between authors with different positions, it becomes clear (at least: at 'first glance') that PhD students indeed have a lower mean-SDI than all other positions. Interestingly, researchers without any teaching position at the university seem to score relatively high at the SDI measure, indicating that being more 'loosely' bound to a university might foster interdisciplinary possibilities. The 'other' category represents unknown or unclear positions, and should be ignored as such.
