@1
Estimation by stochastic approximation algorithm.
=================================================

Random initialization of random number stream.
Current random number seed is 659907.
Effects object used: myeff_test 
Model Type:
 Standard actor-oriented model 
Estimation method: conditional moment estimation.
Conditioning variable is the total number of observed changes ("distance") 
in the network variable.
Distance for simulations is  256 .
Standard errors are estimated with the likelihood ratio method.
Dolby method (regression on scores) is used.
Initial value of gain parameter is  0.2000000.
Reduction factor for gain parameter is  0.5000000.
Number of subphases in Phase 2 is 4.

Initial parameter values are 
  0. Rate parameter                           1.8228
  1. eval:  outdegree (density)                            -1.7755
  2. eval:  reciprocity                                     0.0000


Values of target statistics are
  1. Number of ties                                                     204.0000
  2. Number of reciprocated ties                                         48.0000
These were calculated from the data.

@2
End of stochastic approximation algorithm, phase 3.
---------------------------------------------------

Total of 2173 iterations.
Parameter estimates based on 1173 iterations,
basic rate parameter as well as 
convergence diagnostics, covariance and derivative matrices based on 1000 iterations.

Information for convergence diagnosis.
Averages, standard deviations, and t-ratios for deviations from targets:
  1.   0.1840  12.6303   0.0146 
  2.   0.2920   8.5005   0.0344 

Good convergence is indicated by the t-ratios being close to zero.

Overall maximum convergence ratio =  0.0351 .

     0.022     -0.025
    -0.672      0.064

Derivative matrix of expected statistics X by parameters and
covariance/correlation matrix of X can be found using
summary(ans) within R, or by using the 'verbose' option in Siena07.
